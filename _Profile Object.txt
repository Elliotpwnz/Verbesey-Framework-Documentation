----------    _Profile object    -----------
--------------------------------------------

A new _Profile object can be created with the 
following syntax: 

p = new _Profile(pID) 

The declaration will create a new _Profile 
object, associated with the person whose 
pID was passed.

_Profile.asp is used in conjunction with
showProfile.asp, and is used as the backend
in which showProfile pulls the profile data.
